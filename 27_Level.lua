N This is probably the best time to go ahead and do Blackfathom Deeps |N| Over near Zoram Gar Outpost and it is strongly recommended that you do so|
N You are already on the high end of the level requirement |N|You are already on the high end of the level requirement for the dungeon and there are a lot of quests for it at the Outpost|
N Choose the [Blackfathom Deeps dungeon guide] or next guide |N|Choose one of the dungeon guides or next guide |
N If you complete all of the quests for BFD |N|You will find yourself well into your 28th level and then some and you will be bristling with really good loot. If you are determined to avoid the dungeon you can either return to Raynewood Retreat and grind on Laughing Sisters, or alternatively, head back to Satyrnaar and grind on Satyrs. Satyrnaar is closer to Splintertree Post than the retreat and the Satyrs there will not flag you in PvP|
